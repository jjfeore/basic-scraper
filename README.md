# Scraper for the King County Website - SEA Python 401
*Author: James Feore*
This module scrapes data from the King County health inspection website, and generates a JSON file that can be loaded onto a map and used to view data on the various restaurants that were inspected.

The class website? I just copy-pasted everything from there. Not really sure what we're supposed to be doing. The assignment states that we're supposed to do this in the BeautifulSoup virtualenv we built in class, but we never built such an environment.

*To Install/Run*
```
pip install -e .
python3 src/scraper.py
```
